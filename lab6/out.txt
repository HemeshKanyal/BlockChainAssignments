Objective: Build a full stack Dapp on Ethereum to decentralize the student credentials to do the
following:
✓
✓
✓
✓

The admin of the University can add student credential records
Students can view their credentials
Credentials are tamper-proof and auditable
Each credential update is recorded through events

Outcomes: After executing this assignment, the students will be able to design, code, compile, deploy,
test and run a full stack Dapp.

Tasks for Assessment
Task 1: Smart Contract Design & Implementation (Core Logic)

Objective: Implement the credential storage contract.
Requirements:
•
•

•

Write a Solidity smart contract UniversityCredentials.sol in contracts directory.
Implement:
o addCredential() → Only Admin can add student credentials.
o getCredential() → Students can view their credentials.
o Role-based access control (Admin vs Student).
Use:
o
o

•

mapping(address => Credential)
struct Credential { string degree; string grade; uint256 year; }

Deploy using Hardhat.
struct Credential { string name; string course; string hash; uint issuedOn; }
mapping: address => Credential[]
Functions:
Function

Access

Purpose

addCredential(student, name, course, docHash) Admin only

Adds new credential

getCredentials(student)

Public view

Returns student credentials

updateCredential(student, index, newHash)

Admin only

Updates credential hash

Events:
•
•

CredentialAdded
CredentialUpdated

Task2: Event Logging & Auditability

Objective: Ensure tamper-proof and auditable updates.

Requirements:

•
•
•
•
•

•

Define events:
event CredentialAdded(address indexed student, string degree, uint256 year);
event CredentialUpdated(address indexed student, uint256 timestamp);

Emit events on every add/update.
Use Hardhat tests to:
o Verify event emission
o Verify correct parameters
Demonstrate event retrieval using:
o Hardhat console
o or Ethers.js/Web3.js filters

Compile: npx hardhat compile

Task3: Unit Testing using Hardhat & Chai.

Create: test/Credential.test.js
Test cases:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Admin can add credentials
Non-admin cannot add credentials
Student can view credentials
Admin can update credential
Event emitted correctly

Run: npx hardhat test
a) Start Local Blockchain: npx hardhat node
b) Deploy to localhost: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
c) Export ABI & Address: Copy ABI from artifacts, Store it in frontend folder, Store contract
address in a config file
Task4: Frontend Integration (React and web3.js/Ether.js)
Objective: Build user interface for Admin and Students.

Requirements:
•

•
•
•

React frontend with:
o Admin login (MetaMask)
o Student login (wallet-based)
Admin Panel:
o Add credential form
Student Panel:
o View credentials
Display:
o Transaction hash
o Event logs

School of Computer Science Engineering and Technology

Do the following:
a) Create React App
cd ..; mkdir frontend; cd frontend; npm create vite@latest; npm install; npm
install web3; npm run dev

b) MetaMask Connect Page: Frontend must connect wallet, show account, show chainId, show
“wrong network” warning
c) Student Dashboard- Student enters address and can fetch credentials using
getCredentials(student)and display credentials in a table
d) Admin Dashboard- Admin must be able to add credential, update credential, and see event log
updates
e) Event Listener (Web3.js)- Students must listen to: CredentialAdded and CredentialUpdated
Task5: Security & Integrity Assessment
Objective: Prove credentials are tamper-proof.

Requirements:
•

Implement:
o
o

•

onlyAdmin modifier

Prevent unauthorized updates

Add:
o
o

•

Credential hashing using keccak256 (SHA3)
Store hash of credential data
Write test cases to:
o Attempt unauthorized modification
o Validate hash consistency

Task6: Deploy to Sepolia Testnet- Add Alchemy/Infura RPC, Add MetaMask testnet, Verify contract

Submission Instructions:
1. Submission requires the screen shots of all the incurred steps to execute a smart contract or a
video showing the whole process.
2. All these files are in single zip folder.
3. Use the naming convention: Prog_CourseCode_RollNo_LabNo.docx (Example:
BTech4thSem_CSET226_ E21CSEU002_Lab1)
4. Submission is through LMS only
5. The copied assignment will become automatically zero and attract penalty of -1 mark for each
copied for all whosoever assignments are ditto same.
